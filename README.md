This case is heavily based on Smelties Hyperion https://github.com/Smeltie/Hyperion but trying to fix the strap part (i read that it tends to break) but i wasn't able to make it as pretty :3 

**WARNING**
-Depending on your printer and printer settings the case lid might not fit perfectly, and since it has no clips to attach you might have to use an iron to put it all together at the end. Same with the middle layer, it has a really tight tolerance so you might have to sand it down. (sorry im new to 3D Printing :c)
 
-Please be sure to check the distances for the connectors for the charging port and the micro-controller, since the caliper i used for measuring was not the best and had to use a soldering iron to make sure it had room for the connection.

**SECONDARY IMU CASE**
The case for the secondary IMU has no way to be mounted to your body, i plan on adding something to strap to your body for now i have been using tape :p. I personally use JST connection for the IMU but im aware that the space for the connection is not the best, and the size of the hole is also not big enough. 



**-----Building process-------**

After printing and checking tolerances between the parts, first put the battery in, and put the cables through the hole of the middle part (solder cable extensions if needed, please don't burn your house down) then cut the little wings of the switch and place it in the middle piece (with some wires solder to it https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/tracker-schematics.html), now put the middle piece on the bigger one making sure the side with the switch goes on first (kind of sideways). Then you can solder all of your components together and test it (Make sure to configure your Firmware correctly, i personally recommend building it yourself instead of using the webpage).
After you've tested it put every component on its place  and accommodate the wires on top of everything, **make sure your battery connections are isolated**, use tape or hot glue to make sure is not touching anything else.
Now you can put the lid on and if its not closing itself with friction use a soldering iron on the borders to kind of glue it in.
If my obviously well written explanation (/s) is not clear enough for you try searching a building tutorial for Hyperion/Zaku case since the parts are similar



If i find some motivation i might add some videos/photos of the process, and if i have time i will fix the issues above
If you have any doubts, recommendations, or help dm me on discord :3, or join the discord server, the DIY community there is really nice
